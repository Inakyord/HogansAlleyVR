## 🎮 How to Play

Your goal is simple: test your reflexes and aim! Enemies and innocents will pop up in the alley windows. You must identify the threats and take them down before the time runs out.

### Controls

The game automatically detects your platform and adjusts the control scheme:

| Platform | Aiming | Shooting |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PC / Mac** | Move the **Mouse** to look around. | Click **Left Mouse Button** to fire. |
| **iOS / Mobile** | **Physically rotate your phone** (Gyroscope) to aim like a "Magic Window". | **Tap anywhere** on the screen to fire. |

### Rules & Scoring

* **⏱️ Time Limit:** You have **40 seconds** to get the highest score possible.
* **✅ +1 Point:** Shoot an **Enemy** (Look for the guns!).
* **❌ -1 Point:** Shoot an **Innocent** (Civilians, Police, etc.).
* **Game Loop:** Targets appear in groups of 3. Once you shoot (or wait too long), the group disappears and a new one spawns instantly.
